      "PUBLIC NOTICE Pursuant to the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act and the Wyoming Public Service Commission's (Commission) Procedural Rules and Special Regulations, notice is hereby given of the Joint Application of Marathon Oil Company (Marathon), Red Butte Pipe Line Company (\"Red Butte\"), and Merit Energy Operations I, LLC (Merit) (collectively the Joint Applicants) for approval of a partial reorganization of a public utility which will result in Merit acquiring 100% equity interest in Red Butte from Marathon, as more fully described below. Red Butte is a public utility as defined in W.S. Â§ 37-1-101(a)(vi)(G), and as such, is subject to the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant to W.S. Â§ 37-2-112. Red Butte is a Delaware corporation engaged in the business of operating an interstate crude oil and petroleum transportation pipeline from the Big Horn Basin in northwest Wyoming to either Casper, Wyoming to the south, or north to Silver Tip in Billings, Montana (Pipeline System), with its business office located in Houston, Texas. Red Butte is a wholly owned subsidiary of Marathon. Merit is a Delaware limited liability company, affiliated and operated by Merit Energy Company, LLC, which has operations throughout United States, with approximately 1,300 miles of hydrocarbon gathering and transmission lines, which includes a 225-mile natural gas liquids line in northeast Michigan. Merit's business office is located in Dallas, Texas. On April 18, 2016, the Joint Applicants filed the Joint Application with the Commission pursuant to W.S. Â§ 37-1-104 and Chapter 3, Section 21(f) of the Commission's Rules requesting Commission approval of the reorganization of Red Butte. Upon the reorganization of Red Butte, if approved, Merit will acquire 100% equity interest in Red Butte from Marathon and will maintain Marathon's current contract with Marathon Pipe Line LLC, which will continue as contract operator of the Pipeline System. On April 7, 2016, the Joint Applicants entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (Agreement) whereby Merit will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Red Butte from Marathon and consequently that portion of the Pipeline System located in Wyoming. Closing of this transaction is set for June 30, 2016, assuming receipt of all regulatory approvals. Specifically, the Agreement states the Red Butte exchange of shares will cost approximately $102 million. The Joint Applicants represent that the ultimate financing for the transaction is expected to consist of 100% equity. The Joint Applicants represent that they do not expect the reorganization to have any adverse impact on Red Butteâ€™s ability to serve the public. The Joint Application also states that after the reorganization, the Joint Applicants do not expect any functional change to the operation of Red Butteâ€™s pipeline transportation services in Wyoming and does not seek to revise the rates in its current tariffs at this time. This is not a complete description of the Joint Application. The Joint Application is on file with the Commission at its offices in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and may be inspected by any interested person during regular business hours. Anyone desiring to file a public comment, statement, intervention petition, protest or request for a public hearing in this matter must file with the Commission in writing on or before May 16, 2016. Any intervention request filed with the Commission shall set forth the grounds of the proposed intervention or request for hearing as well as the position and the interest of the petitioner in this proceeding.
